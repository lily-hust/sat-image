This is a site to display some works of image processing, remote sensing, and GIS. If you are interested in these projects please feel free to contact us at the emails in the bottom of this page.

<h3> -Image enhancement </h3>
<img src="images/enhancement.gif"  alt="Enhancement" height="128" />
<h3><This program restores the brightness of the pictures or videos acquired at under-lighting environment, such as night, and smoky or foggy environment. The pictures or videos can be improved as if they were acquired at day light. ></h3>

<h3> -Image segmentation </h3>
<img src="images/4.JPG"  alt="Segmentation" height="128" />
<h3><This program provides a multiple scale image segmentation method. It divides the image into regions, called objects. Within each region the pixels have similar characteristics. When the image analysis is implemented on the objects instead of pixels, the workload and the noises can be reduced greatly. This technique can be applied for other kinds of raster data.></h3>

<h3> -Atmospheric correction </h3>
<img src="images/7.JPG"  alt="Atmospheric correction" height="128" />
<h3><This project uses double or triple images to retrieve the surface reflectance in a short period. It yields Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and surface reflectance in the meanwhile. It is used together with a parallel 6S model for AOD retrieval, which we developed as a refined version of the last 6S model.></h3>

<h3> -AOD retrieval </h3>

<h3><This map shows an instance of AOD retrieval of Beijing using the method introduced above.></h3>

<h3> -Building extraction and modeling </h3>
<img src="images/3.JPG"  alt="Buildings" height="128" />
<h3><This program creates the 2D contour polygon models automatately from the Digital Surface Model (DSM) and the spectral image. The buildings are detected using mathematical morphology based method from DSM. Image is used to delete the false detection of trees, as well as to get the accurate locations and shapes of the buildings. The processing also include model refining to meet the truth of orthogonal edges. ></h3>

<h3> -Road extraction and modeling </h3>
<img src="images/5.JPG"  alt="Road extraction" height="128" />
<h3><This program creates the road network from DSM. It is also based on mathematical morphology. The procedure includes distance tramsform, center line, side line and intersection extractions. Spatial relationship based reasoning is developed and applied for the road model creation.></h3>

<h3> -Example map of most popular countries 2016 </h3>
<img src = "images/1.pdf" alt = "10m level arrival" height = "128" />
<h3><This map shows the countries in dark color of most popular countries in the world in 2016. The number of arrival tuorists to any of these countries is over 10 millions. ></h3>

<h3> -<image dataset of objects from nadir view> </h3>
<h3> < This link conclude object images derived the satellite images, eg. LandSAT, GeoEye. There are 5 father classes, water, vegetation, bare land, built area, and unclarified, and more sub-classes. > </h3>
